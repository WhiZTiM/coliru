Enter the number of multipliers you would like to use (up to 50)
Next, you will enter the mutliples you want to use.
(for example, if you want to find the sum of the multipliers of 3 and
5 below a given amount, enter 3 as 'multiplier 1' and 5 as 'multiplier 2')
Enter 'multiplier 1'
Enter 'multiplier 2'
Enter the the limit for how high you want to add the multipliers
(for example, you could set the limit to 1000 to find the sum of the
multipliers of 3 and 5 (if you entered those) less than and or equal to 1000)
The sum is 100500
